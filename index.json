experience in Software Engineering and Distributed Systems. I see computer science not only as a profession but as a hobby. I am experienced in engineering highly distributed dynamic and cloud computing systems, in leadership roles focused on implementing optimal ways of working and shipping solutions to interesting problems. I thrive in challenging projects with emerging technologies, striving to stay ahead of the latest technological advancements. In my free time I try to stay active in the community and contribute to open source projects and the academia.\nI have expert knowledge of programming languages such as Java, Go, Python, Bash etc.\nI am experienced in highly dynamic cloud native systems and platforms such as Kubernetes, Mesos and CloudFoundry based on public (e.g AWS*, GCP, Azure), private (e.g CloudStack, Openstack) and/or hybrid infrastructures. My experience spans a breadth of industries such as Government, EU, Health, Traveling and Finance in challenging projects ranging from local to international deployments and user bases with up to tens of thousands of users.\nWhat motivates me ? Motivated by the passion to solve problems, I tend to describe a love for technology. I especially like the sometimes complex and unpredictable challenges that arise from working as part of a team, pair or mob. Bringing together the people factor and technology is what keeps my mind active and raring to go. Customer and user centric, I believe the client is at the centre of every solution. I believe that each client requirement brings with it a new challenge to balance trade-offs, and utilise technologies creatively towards the most valuable solution - problem solving at its finest. I am driven by results. I like to achieve a concrete goal, knowing I have applied the optimal strategy for accomplishing it. I tend to thrive on working toward such goals in a collaborative environment and sharing knowledge along the way.
