I am a hands-on professional with 5+ years of experience in [Solutions Arcitecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_architecture) and 15+ years of experience in [Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) and [Distributed Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing). I see computer science not only as a profession but as a hobby. I am experienced in engineering highly distributed dynamic and [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) systems, in leadership roles focused on implementing optimal ways of working and shipping solutions to interesting problems. I thrive in challenging projects with emerging  technologies, striving to stay ahead of the latest technological advancements. In my free time I try to stay active in the community and contribute to open source projects and the academia.

I have expert knowledge of programming languages such as [Java](https://www.java.com), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) etc. 

I am experienced in highly dynamic cloud native systems and platforms such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/) and [CloudFoundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) based on public _(e.g [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)*, [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com))_, private _(e.g [CloudStack](https://cloudstack.apache.org/), [Openstack](https://www.openstack.org/))_ and/or hybrid infrastructures. My experience spans a breadth of industries such as _Government_, _EU_, _Health_, _Traveling_ and _Finance_ in challenging projects ranging from local to international deployments and user bases with up to tens of thousands of users.

## What motivates me ?
-	Motivated by the passion to solve problems, I tend to describe a love for technology. I especially like the sometimes complex and unpredictable challenges that arise from working as part of a team, pair or mob. Bringing together the people factor and technology is what keeps my mind active and raring to go. 
-	Customer and user centric, I believe the client is at the centre of every solution. I believe that each client requirement brings with it a new challenge to balance trade-offs, and utilise technologies creatively towards the most valuable solution - problem solving at its finest. 
- I am driven by results. I like to achieve a concrete goal, knowing I have applied the optimal strategy for accomplishing it. I tend to thrive on working toward such goals in a collaborative environment and sharing knowledge along the way.
