[camel-kafka](https://github.com/ipolyzos/camel-kafka) is an [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) component that allows you to work with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) message oriented middleware directly trough your [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) routes and take advantage of it towards highly perforning intergations.
