[vagranetes](https://github.com/ipolyzos/vagranetes) is a multi-node [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) setup utilizing [kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm) within [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) virtual machines. This project represents the evolution of [vagrant-kube](https://github.com/ipolyzos/vagrant-kube), and its implementation is grounded on a script based on [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for configuring a multi-node [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster via [kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm). Its primary objective is to serve as a local testing environment for the present [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) version, thereby providing a reliable and convenient testbed.
