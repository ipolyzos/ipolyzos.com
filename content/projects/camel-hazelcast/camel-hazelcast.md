[camel-hazelcast](https://github.com/ipolyzos/camel-hazelcast) component implements a [work-queue](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/7.0.9?topic=allocation-work-queues) on top of the [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) in-memory data-grid. Its purpose is to support asynchronous [SEDA architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture), similar to the core [camel "SEDA" component](https://camel.apache.org/components/3.20.x/seda-component.html).
