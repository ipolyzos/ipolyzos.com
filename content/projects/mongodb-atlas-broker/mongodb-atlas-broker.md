The [mongodb-atlas-broker](https://github.com/ipolyzos/mongodb-atlas-broker) facilitates the provision of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) databases as a [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) service. It should be noted that this broker does not entail a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) server or cluster. Rather, it is designed to be deployed in conjunction with a managed [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) cluster that it oversees, as a deployment of the managed services offered by [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).
