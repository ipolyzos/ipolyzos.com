The [elephantsql-broker](https://github.com/ipolyzos/elephantsql-broker) offers [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) users the ability to procure [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database instances as and when required. It is important to note that the service broker does not in itself encompass a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) server or cluster, but rather functions as a complementary tool that is intended to be deployed in conjunction with a managed [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) account. This account enables the provisioning and maintenance of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) instances through APIs.
