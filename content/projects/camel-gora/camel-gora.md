The objective of the [camel-gora](https://github.com/ipolyzos/camel-gora) project is to establish a seamless integration mechanism between [Apache Gora](https://gora.apache.org/) and [Apache-Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) routes, thereby leveraging the high performance of NoSQL databases in [Apache-Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) routing capabilities.
