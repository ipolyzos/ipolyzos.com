[vagrant-kube](https://github.com/ipolyzos/vagrant-kube) is a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) single-node setup within a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) virtual machine, designed to function as a local playground and testing environment for the latest Kubernetes version. The project is founded on the "Kubernetes in Vagrant with kubeadm" methodology authored by Liz Rice.
