The [vagrant-k3s](https://github.com/ipolyzos/vagrant-k3s) project is an experimental implementation of a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) single-node configuration utilizing k3s within a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) VM running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) 16.4. Its primary objective is to provide a local sandbox and testing environment for [k3s](https://k3s.io), and it is not intended for deployment in production.
