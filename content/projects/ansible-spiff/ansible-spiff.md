The [ansible-spiff](https://github.com/ipolyzos/ansible-spiff/) module is a binary module integrated within [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), offering extensive support for utilizing the [Spiff](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff) deployment manifest builder. The module functions as a wrapper for the [Spiff](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff) CLI, allowing the merge and diff operations to be effectively executed within the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) framework.
