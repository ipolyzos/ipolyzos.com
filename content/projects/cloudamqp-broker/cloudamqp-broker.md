[cloudampq-broker](https://github.com/ipolyzos/cloudamqp-broker) offers [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) message broker instances as a [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry) service, which can be availed on demand. It's important to note that the broker itself does not encompass a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) server or cluster. Its purpose is to be deployed alongside a managed [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/) account that provides [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) instance provisioning and maintenance through APIs.
